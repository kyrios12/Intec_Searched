## Task 1: STL File Handling

### Introduction
STL, which stands for Stereolithography, is a common file format used in 3D printing. It defines the geometry of a 3D object through a collection of triangular facets. This task involves handling STL files, but unfortunately, the attached file was inaccessible, and attempts to resolve the issue with the concerned candidate were unsuccessful.

## Task 2: OpenCV - Perspective Transformation

### Overview
Perspective transformation is an image manipulation technique that enables users to choose the perspective from which they view an image. In the context of OpenCV, this task likely involves utilizing OpenCV's functions for perspective transformation.

## Task 3: String Compression and Decompression

### Problem Statement
The objective here is to compress and decompress strings in Java. Various approaches were explored, and the chosen method achieves the desired output efficiently.

### Approach
The selected approach involves compressing consecutive repeated characters without explicitly indicating the count, providing a concise representation of the input string.

## Task 4: Hashing Algorithm

### Research and Findings
Hashing algorithms play a crucial role in various applications. The search involved exploring real-life use cases of hashing algorithms and understanding how to map 100 numbers into 10 elements using hashing.

## Task 5: Dot and Vector Product

### Context
This task delves into the implementation of dot and vector product operations, particularly in a graphics environment. The search aimed to uncover the significance of these operations in vector graphics and their practical applications.

## Task 6: Intersection between Ray and Triangle

### Concept Exploration
The concept of determining the intersection between a ray and a triangle is essential in graphic design. Researching this query led to the discovery of algorithms designed to solve this common problem, enhancing understanding in the realm of graphic design.

**Note:** Each task involved thorough research and exploration to gain insights into the respective topics. While some tasks were successfully completed, others faced challenges, such as issues with file accessibility or unresponsive communication with relevant parties.
